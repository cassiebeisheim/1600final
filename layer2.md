# 2: The Data Link Layer

![Second Layer](https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3TLHavXiotb9ayyZFKECf3/9456d1c431cd71ceea7f4b407f076f11/data_link_layer_osi_model.png)

### The data link layer is the second layer in the model. It is responsible for the transmission of data frames between devices within a network. This layer obtains the data from the physical layer and proceeds to check for errors and put the bits into data frames. This is also the layer that is responsible for MAC Addressing for Ethernet networks. Due to it's complexity, it is also often split into the Media Access Control and Logical Link Control sub-layers.
