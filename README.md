# Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model: The basics
### By Cassie Beisheim

## Hello and welcome to my OSI Model basics tutorial. The OSI Model is a crucial aspect to understanding computing systems and how they work. While we no longer actively use the model (we use the TCP/IP model), it is still helpful in understanding how to troubleshoot errors and for one's overall understanding of functionality. 

### This tutorial is targeted at any individuals with little to moderate understanding of the OSI model, such as students taking a 1000 level course such as this one in a major that requires knowledge of it. 

## There are seven layers within the OSI Model, and I will be providing some information regarding each layer on the following pages:

- [Layer 1: Physical](layer1.md)
- [Layer 2: Data Link](layer2.md)
- [Layer 3: Network](layer3.md)
- [Layer 4: Transport](layer4.md)
- [Layer 5: Session](layer5.md)
- [Layer 6: Presentation](layer6.md)
- [Layer 7: Application](layer7.md)
