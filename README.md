## Hello and welcome to my OSI Model basics tutorial. The OSI Model is a crucial aspect to understanding computing systems and how they work. 

## There are seven layers within the OSI Model, and I will be providing some information regarding each layer on the following pages:

- [Layer 1: Physical](layer1.md)
- [Layer 2: Data Link](layer2.md)
- [Layer 3: Network](layer3.md)
- [Layer 4: Transport](layer4.md)
- [Layer 5: Session](layer5.md)
- [Layer 6: Presentation](layer6.md)
